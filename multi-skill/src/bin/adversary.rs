/*
    The following file alters the contest history of "tourist",
    the #1 competitive programmer of the past decade. The alterations
    consists of two phases:
        1) A volatility farming phase, where tourist alternatingly wins and loses
           (We do this by either retaining his performance in contest, or moving
            him to the bottom of the contest)
        2) A rating farming phase, where tourist performs as usual (near the top)
           and rapidly gains rating from his high volatility.
